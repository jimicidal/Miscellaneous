Keeping track of the devices I have as I migrate to a new system.

# Hubs
- **Homey Pro early 2023**
  - URL: https://homey.app/en-us/homey-pro/
  - Why: Clean interface, easy to use, wide protocol support. Didn't want to manually maintain a janky HomeSeer or HomeAssistant deployment anymore.
- **Amazon Echo Dot 4th Gen**
  - URL: https://www.amazon.com/Echo-4th-Gen/dp/B07XKF5RM3
  - Why: Voice control. 3.5mm audio jack output to studio monitors.
- **Lutron Caseta Smart Hub**
  - URL: https://www.casetawireless.com/us/en/products/expansion-kits-and-smart-bridge/smart-hub-formerly-smart-bridge
  - Why: Required for the Caseta dimmers

# Z-wave devices
- **Enbrighten 700 series outlet**
  - URL: https://enbrightenme.com/enbrighten-z-wave-in-wall-tamper-resistant-smart-outlet-white
  - Why: Needed higher wattage rating for the espresso machine; Also needed better z-wave coverage.
- **Zooz ZEN37 scene controller**
  - URL: https://www.getzooz.com/zen37-wall-remote/
  - Why: New light switches do not have built-in scene controllers; These can be stuck anywhere.
- **Silicon Labs slusb7000a**
  - URL: https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/z-wave/efr32zg14-usb-7-z-wave-700-stick-bridge-module
  - Why: Mostly to poke at. It's currently serving as a range extender.

# Zigbee devices
- **Innr smart plug 15A US**
  - URL: https://www.innr.com/en/product/innr-smart-plug-15a-us/
  - Why: Power meter. Smaller size and better protocol than the previous WiFi 2.4 GHz plugs we used.

# Bluetooth devices
- **Philips Hue E26 soft warm white model 800**
  - URL: https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-a19-e26-smart-bulb-60-w-4-pack/046677476977#overview
  - Why: Unfinished basement with not enough light switches.

# Wi-fi devices
- **Ecobee 3 lite thermostat**
  - URL: https://www.ecobee.com/en-us/smart-thermostats/smart-wifi-thermostat/
  - Why: It came with the house.

# Other protocols
- **Lutron Caseta Diva dimmers**
  - URL: https://www.casetawireless.com/us/en/product/diva-smart-dimmer/homeowner
  - Why: No neutral wire required.
 
# Tried and failed
- **Eve Energy Outlet**
  - URL: https://www.evehome.com/en-us/eve-energy-outlet
  - Why: Didn't pair with Homey. Wanted the power meter and Matter over Thread.
 
# Old stuff to replace
- HomeSeer motion detectors, inside & outside
- Locks
