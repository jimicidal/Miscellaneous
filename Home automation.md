Keeping track of the devices I have as I migrate to a new system.

# Hubs
- **Homey Pro early 2023**
  - URL: https://homey.app/en-us/homey-pro/
  - Why: Clean interface, easy to use, wide protocol support. Didn't want to manually maintain a janky HomeSeer or HomeAssistant deployment anymore.
- **Lutron Caseta Smart Hub**
  - URL: https://www.casetawireless.com/us/en/products/expansion-kits-and-smart-bridge/smart-hub-formerly-smart-bridge
  - Why: Required for the Caseta dimmers

# Z-wave devices
- **Enbrighten 700 series outlet**
  - URL: https://enbrightenme.com/enbrighten-z-wave-in-wall-tamper-resistant-smart-outlet-white
  - Why: Needed higher wattage rating for the espresso machine; Also needed better z-wave coverage.
- **Zooz ZEN37 scene controller**
  - URL: https://www.getzooz.com/zen37-wall-remote/
  - Why: New light switches do not have built-in scene controllers; These can be stuck anywhere.
- **Silicon Labs slusb7000a**
  - URL: https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/z-wave/efr32zg14-usb-7-z-wave-700-stick-bridge-module
  - Why: Mostly to poke at. It's currently serving as a range extender.
- **Zooz ZSE18 motion detector**
  - URL: https://www.getzooz.com/zooz-zse18-s2-motion-sensor/
  - Why: Testing - it's good.

# Zigbee devices
- **Innr smart plug 15A US**
  - URL: https://www.innr.com/en/product/innr-smart-plug-15a-us/
  - Why: Power meter. Smaller size and better protocol than the previous Wi-Fi 2.4 GHz plugs we used.
- **Sonoff SNZB-06P human presence detector**
  - URL: https://sonoff.tech/product/gateway-and-sensors/snzb-06p/
  - Why: Presence detection vs. motion detection for long study sessions.
- **Aeotec motion detector**
  - URL: https://aeotec.com/products/aeotec-motion-sensor/
  - Why: Testing - works great!

# Bluetooth devices
- **Philips Hue E26 soft warm white model 800**
  - URL: https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-a19-e26-smart-bulb-60-w-4-pack/046677476977
  - Why: Unfinished basement does not have enough light switches.

# Wi-Fi devices
- **Ecobee 3 premium thermostat**
  - URL: https://www.ecobee.com/en-us/smart-thermostats/smart-wifi-thermostat/
  - Why: Needed 5GHz Wi-Fi device after 2.4GHz-capable Wi-Fi router died.
- **Roomba J9+**
  - URL: https://www.irobot.com/en_US/roomba-j9plus-self-emptying-robot-vacuum/J955020.html
  - Why: Needed 5GHz Wi-Fi device after 2.4GHz-capable Wi-Fi router died. 2.4GHz Shark lives in the basement now.

# Other protocols
- **Lutron Caseta Diva dimmers**
  - URL: https://www.casetawireless.com/us/en/product/diva-smart-dimmer/homeowner
  - Why: No neutral wire required.
 
# Tried and failed
- **Eve Energy Outlet**
  - URL: https://www.evehome.com/en-us/eve-energy-outlet
  - Why: Didn't pair with Homey. Wanted the power meter and Matter over Thread.
- **Amazon Echo Dot 4th Gen**
  - URL: https://www.amazon.com/Echo-4th-Gen/dp/B07XKF5RM3
  - Why: Got it for voice control & 3.5mm audio jack output to studio monitors. It worked fine, but I deleted my Amazon account.
- **Ecobee 3 lite thermostat**
  - URL: https://www.ecobee.com/en-us/smart-thermostats/smart-wifi-thermostat/
  - Why: It came with the house; removed when 2.4GHz-capable Wi-Fi router died.
 
# Old stuff to replace
- Locks
- Garage door controller
