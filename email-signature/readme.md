# Email signature
This is a VBA script for systems administrators who want to keep user email signatures conforming to a pre-defined template.

Automating signatures eliminates the need to create, maintain, disseminate, and discuss end user documentaion on how to change them.

It also reduces the problem of users forgetting or refusing to update their email signatures themselves, making unapproved style or content changes, etc.
