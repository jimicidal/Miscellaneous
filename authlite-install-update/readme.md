# AuthLite install/update
AuthLite wants you to deploy their MSI via Group Policy. When a new version comes out, you have to update the GPO. Why not run this script instead?

This script is intended to run as a Datto RMM component. That allows you to decide whether to force an update of the installed version of AuthLite while you're scheduling the script to run.
