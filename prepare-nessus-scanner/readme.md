# Prepare Nessus scanner
This script is not meant to be run in its entirety. It contains three smaller scriptlets that each serve the same purpose, but for different distributions of Linux.

The code for each distro prepares a fresh Linux VM for use as a Nessus scanner under Tenable.SC.

Each VM is also dropped into a Datto RMM site for management & monitoring.
