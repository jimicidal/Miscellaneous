- [ ] Whisk
- [ ] Silicone spatula
- [ ] Bowl scraper (optional)
- [ ] Bench knife (optional)
- [ ] Proofing box (optional)
- [ ] Two Pyrex loaf pans
- [ ] Tea kettle (optional)
- [ ] Bread lame, or sharp knife
- [ ] Pizza stone (optional)
- [ ] Wire rack
## Ingredients
#### Wet stuff
- [ ] 528 g warm (110 째F) water
- [ ] 56 g raw sugar
- [ ] 12 g yeast
- [ ] 16 g salt
- [ ] 40 g extra virgin olive oil
#### Dry stuff
- [ ] 406 g spelt flour
- [ ] 406 g high protein bread flour
- [ ] 78 g hulled hemp seeds
- [ ] 78 g raw hulled sunflower nuts
- [ ] 78 g raw pumpkin seeds
#### Topping
- [ ] .25 cup everything bagel seasoning

## Procedure
### Make the dough
- In a large bowl, dissolve the sugar in the water. Whisk it until it's gone
- Add the yeast and whisk again. Let it sit for a few minutes
	- While you wait, mix the flours & seeds together in another bowl
- Add the olive oil and salt to the water, whisk again to dissolve
- Now you can add the dry ingredients to the water
	- Use the silicone spatula to mix in the first half, then add the rest
- Knead it for several minutes
	- The dough should be pretty sticky. Just power through, it will come together eventually
	- Do not add flour. Use a bowl scraper to get it off your hands and the counter, then slap it all back together and keep going
	- If you don't know how to knead, fold one cheek over into the middle and mash it down. Turn the whole thing 90 degrees - a new side of the dough will be in that same spot. Grab the cheek, fold it to the middle and mash it down. You have to do this for longer than you think
	- You might not get a windowpane due to the seeds and/or spelt flour, but it should be close
### Bulk ferment
- Lightly coat the dough in olive oil and put it in a large, lightly covered bowl
	- Try to keep moisture in, but still allow some gas exchange
- Proof at 80 째F for two hours, or until it's doubled in size
### Final proof
- If you're using a proofing box, boil some water in a kettle or on the stove
- Preheat the oven and pizza stone to 365 째F
- Lightly oil the loaf pans and set them aside
- Use the bench knife or bowl scraper to split the dough into two 850 g balls
- Shape each ball to fit the loaf pans and **ROLL THEM AROUND IN THE EVERYTHING BAGEL SEASONING**
- Put the loaves in the oiled pans and proof again at 80 째F for 20-30 minutes
	- Ideally, in a proofing box with a cup of boiling water
	- You can also dampen a flour-sack-type towel with hot water and cover the pans, just watch to make sure it doesn't stick to the dough
### Cook it
- Score the top of each loaf and put more everything bagel seasoning in the cracks
- Bake for 34 minutes on a rack just above the pizza stone
- Take the loaves out of the pans and let them cool completely on a wire rack
